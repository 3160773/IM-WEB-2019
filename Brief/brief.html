<p> When we think about memories, we tend to think about the intentional and automatic process of making and reminiscing certain events. But forgetting is also a part of memory too. In fact, it also may be a part of remembering as well. We pick and choose certain information of events to work out what's worth keeping and what's not worth keeping. The ones that are unkept fades away, and the ones that are are used as references to bookmark the events. I wanted to use this concept by having: </p>

<ol>1. The user inputting their name to create their own memory file </ol>

<ol>2. Joint particles that are all connected and the user has to actively click to subtract the connected joint particles </ol>

<ol>3. The leftover joint particles turns into solid shapes and then it slowly fades away. To stop some of them from fading, the user has to click over the shapes as well.</ol>

<ol>4. After all the subtracting, the leftover outcome works as the main "points" or "references" of a memory. The user can save it and name this particle whatever they want, and the website will send these memories via email. This shows how we can save specific parts of memories into the digital world.</ol>
