1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
</br>
</p>

<p class="a1">
In a world where computers are becoming invisible, Don Norman believes that users too, should be made invisible. It’s becoming a common notion where the less you think about the technical aspect, the more room you will have for creativity (i.e Adobe). However, Lialina strongly argues that this idea of reducing user involvement and making the user “invisible” would turn out to be dangerous; she believes that removing the term “user” and replacing it with “people” would be equivalent to getting rid of the last reminder that there <i><b> IS </b> </i> a programmed system that we use. She thinks that the "user" should be thought of as a separate entity from computers; If there is no clear distinction between users and developers, the personal rights as users, which is to have control of their device: to demand for better software, demand for better software and most importantly, to see the computer, would someday disappear.

2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</br>
</p>

<p class="a2">
The ideal user, also known as General Purpose Users, Turing Complete Users or Universal Users, would be those that would ultimately find different ways to approach their tasks without using just one primary method or relying on a specialized app/device. This user would be the perfect reflection of Alan Turing’s concept of a computer, where with enough time and memory, it would be able to perform any type of task its given. Some of these qualities would involve: cropping out a black frame from an instagram picture using a different application, opening a twitter account on two different web browsing platforms, waking up at 7:00 am without setting on alarm on your clock app. Some would intentionally choose to manage these tasks in a certain way, some might not have known there was an alternative in the first place, or they did know but didn’t like it, or maybe they were just too lazy to pursue it. All it really comes down to, and all that matters is that at the end of the day, the user found a way to get what they want.

3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</br>
</p>
 
<p class="a3">
Online shopping requires me to physically type in my credit card information in order to purchase a product; this information has to be manually inputted by the user. Each user would have different set of numbers and additional private information (i.e billing and shipping address) that distinguish themselves from all other users trying to make a purchase. If there is at least one misinformation, there would be two consequences: either the product would not go through the transaction or it would be sent to a different address. Once everything is fully confirmed by me, the user, the item would then be in the process of arriving in front of my doorsteps.
