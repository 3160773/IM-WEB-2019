	<h1>Poetry of Tools Reading Response</h1>

	<h5>Sophia Choi</a> </h5> 


<p class="q1">

1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
</br>
</p>

<p class="a1">
When Seu asks us to “defamiliarize our tools”, I believe that she is asking us to understand what we have to “unlearn”. Once we pull ourselves out of what we are already so used to⁠—the systems that are already laid out for us⁠—we are reminded how these tools work in a certain way under certain circumstances/constraints. After understanding its mechanism, we could figure out different potentials of those tools to generate new ideas or build upon old ones. This action resonates deeply with her use of the word “poetry” because the technology could be used as a tool of expression that can freely and flexibly demonstrate oneself/society/the world. In our case, we are talking about technology as a language, but this concept aligns with how literal language works. People create phrases and sentences to communicate with each other but never consciously ask how these sentences were built, why certain words go with/without other words, how each word came to mean certain things, etc. When learning a language, you need to learn how to “unlearn” by understanding the overall relationship of the alphabets, words, grammar structure, etc to create a sentence where you could freely express yourself.

2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</br>

<p class="a2">
Production of errors is when the product departs from its intended design and exercises a new expression that could be used as a poetic tool. An online interface that reflects this would be Snapchat’s filter camera. The filter camera is built to analyze the shape of an individual's face and to apply the chosen filter onto them. However, a random error occurs where the filter applies to inanimate objects; it distorts the figure of the object rather than applying the filter onto the face. One specific example would be the face switch filter that snapchat included; It was made so that two people could switch their faces within the camera frame. Sometimes there would be an error where the camera would try to find whatever object that resonates a face and would switch them around. It has happened a lot with doorknobs, outlet walls, pets, etc. People made this an on-going trend where they would intentionally find certain objects to switch faces.
