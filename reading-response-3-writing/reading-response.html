1. Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
</br>
</p>

<p class="a1">
Laurel states that the web is now drowning in a commercialized space; people feel pressured to adapt to this norm where ones creativity and individuality is oftentimes neglected. She believes that rather than being the “user” that’s trapped in a repeated space created by societal influence, it’s best to recognize one’s potential to see themselves as the “architect”––the maker of their own space––as well. The possibilities of communicating one’s space/identity is endless. It could be surprising, memorable, monumental, unpredictable, subtle, etc. I believe that we could have a balance of both: expand the possibilities of the web by learning how to work around this commercialized space. Of course, it would be mundane to be fixated in this repetitive existence of social media. Yet, even this space still has its own power when it comes to creating a social hub of connection and a sense of community. I think as designers, one of the exciting parts about our jobs is to observe our environment and see how our ideas could work to expand this further; we should understand why and how these commercialized/social media space work, outline its benefits and use it as an accelerator for our creativity.

2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</br>
