		<div class= "explanation"> I would say the web is like sunset; we appreciate its beauty once it’s over. Sometimes we are so accustomed to the existence of a website that we tend to forget that it’s there, to a point where it’s almost like a part of us.  But once it “sets” itself away, we realize how important or beautiful the website is. </div>
